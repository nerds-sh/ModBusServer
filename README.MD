Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies separately from your global Python installation.

Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

cmd
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
